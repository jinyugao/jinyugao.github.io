Research Experience
======
2022-2023	‘An investigation of how career mobility of scientists and the collaboration networks impact on the scientific outputs’
Master thesis focuses on whether career mobility of scientists could promote the scientific outputs; whether the career mobility would have an influence on the research direction change; how the scientists’ state in the collaboration network have an effect on their scientific outputs.

2021-2022	‘Analysis on the Synergy of the Scientific and Technological Talents Policy Compound System: Taking the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area as an Example’
According to the synergy degree model of the compound system, it divided the scientific and technological talent policies compound system into three subsystems (policy objectives, policy formulation subjects and policy implementation subjects), and measured the order degree of the subsystems and the synergy degree of the compound system.

The results show that: there are long-term co integration and two-way Granger causality between stock index futures and spot market; the CSI 300 stock index futures has the function of price discovery; the dynamic correlation was stable above 0.9, showing a positive correlation.
